# LQR-under-actuated-dynamical-system

The objective is to control an Acrobot, a classical under-actuated dynamical system resembling a gymnast swinging up on a bar. The task involves using an energy shaping controller to swing the Acrobot close to the vertical position and then switching to an LQR controller to maintain the upright equilibrium position. LQR (Linear-Quadratic Regulator) is used to stabilize the system, while the energy shaping controller is employed to bring the Acrobot close to the upright position from its initial hanging down position.
